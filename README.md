# app-design-for-automatically-open-apps
In this simple python app design, we can set several apps into the empty array and press one button to open them all. This software intends to help people fast start their work in the morning or beginning of their work. It will raise the efficiency of people's work. 
In this simple software, I used the tkinter, and os library.
